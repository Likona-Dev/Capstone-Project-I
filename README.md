## Finance Calculator

## Project Details:

### Description

This Finance Calculator is a program written in the Python language. It is a level 1 task 12 
Capstone project for Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp that I am enrolled in.

This program was designed for use by a small financial company, to allow 
them to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home 
loan repayment calculator.

### Funcitionality

The program allows the user to choose which calculation they want to do, either the 
Investment Calculator or the Bond/Home Loan Repayment Calculator.

#### If the Investment calculator is chosen:
##### The user is asked to enter:

The amount of money that they are depositing. 
The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered. 
The number of years they plan on investing for.
Then the user is asked to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and this 
is stored in a variable called interest. Depending on whether they typed “simple” or “compound”, 
the appropriate amount that they will get after the given period at the
interest rate is calculated then outputed. 

If the Bond calculator is chosen:
The user is asked to enter:

The present value of the house.
The interest rate.
The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond.
Then program calculates how much money the user will have to repay each
month and outputs the answer.

### Usefulness

This is a powerful program that will remain relevent for many more years to come. 
Especially since investing has grown more popular in recent years and it's programs similar to this 
that make it so easy for just about anybody to invest.
