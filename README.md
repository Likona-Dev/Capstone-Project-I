# Capstone-Project-I

## Finance Calculator

## Project Details:

### Description

This Finance Calculator is a program written in the Python language. It is a level 1 task 12 
Capstone project for Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp that I am enrolled in.

This program was designed for use by a small financial company, to allow 
them to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home 
loan repayment calculator.

### Funcitionality

The program allows the user to choose which calculation they want to do, either the 
Investment Calculator or the Bond/Home Loan Repayment Calculator.

#### If the Investment calculator is chosen:
##### The user is asked to enter:

The amount of money that they are depositing. 
The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered. 
The number of years they plan on investing for.
Then the user is asked to input whether they want “simple” or “compound” interest, and this 
is stored in a variable called interest. Depending on whether they typed “simple” or “compound”, 
the appropriate amount that they will get after the given period at the
interest rate is calculated then outputed. 

If the Bond calculator is chosen:
The user is asked to enter:

The present value of the house.
The interest rate.
The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond.
Then program calculates how much money the user will have to repay each
month and outputs the answer.

### Usefulness

This is a powerful program that will remain relevent for many more years to come. 
Especially since investing has grown more popular in recent years and it's programs similar to this 
that make it so easy for just about anybody to invest.

## How can I use it?

Firstly, you need to clone this repository with the Task Manager program and related text files to a 
local repository on your computer, so that you can access and run the program. If you need help, 
follow the instructions as set out github help webpage:

*https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

In order to run this program, you will then need to download the Python interpreter program onto your 
computer's operating system (OS) so that the Finance Calculator program can be executed. 
Click on the link below in order to download Python on your OS (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux etc.):

*https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have downloaded Python to your local machine, you will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), 
which is where you can view and run the Python file(finance_calculators.py) from. Python comes with a built-in IDE 
which you can access by opening the IDLE file from the program files that downloaded automatically with the Python interpreter.

When opened, the IDLE python file will display a Python 'shell' window. From this window, you can now click on 'file' and 
then 'open' from the toolbar at the top of the window, to navigate to the Finance Calculator program and open it. Once opened, 
you will be able to view the program code in another file window that will automatically open separately to the Python 'shell'.

When you are ready to run it, you can select 'run' from the top toolbar and then interact with the output displayed in the 
Python shell window. That is where you will be prompted to enter information from your keyboard to choose a calculator and 
then input the necessary details for calculation.

### Contributors

This program was created by myself as the first Capstone Project as a student for a software engineer bootcamp.
This program has been reviewed and commented on by the mentors from the Hyperion Development Software Engineer Bootcamp.
